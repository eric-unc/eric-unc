### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Eric, and I am an incoming computer science PhD student at Virginia Tech.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at @nutanix for the summer, but sometimes I work on various software projects. You can see some of them these [here](https://github.com/eric-unc) on my educational GitHub and [here](https://github.com/xbony2) on my personal GitHub. Sometimes I contribute to wikis, the main one being [here](https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Xbony2).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently contributing to the backend of Nutanix Database Services (NDB). Outside of that, I like to keep up with systems research.
- ðŸ§  I have strong experience in Java, C, and MediaWiki, and basic knowledge of Ruby, Rust, JavaScript, Groovy, HTML, CSS, Assembly (MIPS, x86), and SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB). I have some experience with Lisp, Python, Verilog, Bash, Lua, C#, MATLAB, Mathematica, and TypeScript. Maybe other things, who knows!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [my website](https://eric-unc.tech) has links to everywhere.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- ðŸ¤· A lot of the time information on me online is outdated. This profile picture is 5 years old; I am not as young and cute as I used to be and in fact, I have transformed into a goblin ðŸ‘º. It is what it is!
