### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently mainly working on classwork, but sometimes I'm also working on various software projects. You can see these [here](https://github.com/eric-unc) on my educational GitHub and [here](https://github.com/xbony2) on my personal GitHub. Sometimes, I contribute to wikis, the main one being [here](https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Special:Contributions/Xbony2).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a compiler (for a subset of Java), programming language theory (including learning Racket, writing an interpreter, SML, and Prolog), mathematical methods for the physical sciences (which includes learning Mathematica), combinatorical mathematics, and Spanish.
- 🧠 I have strong experience in Java and MediaWiki, and basic knowledge of Ruby, Groovy, C, JavaScript (Node.js), HTML/CSS, and SQL. I have some experience with Lua, Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, C#, Assembly, and Racket.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you want! I am open to offers.
- 📫 How to reach me: [my website](https://eric-unc.tech) has links to everywhere.
